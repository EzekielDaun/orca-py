# ORCA-py

ORCA-py is an **unofficial** library for the [ORCA Series](https://irisdynamics.com/products/orca-series) motor from Iris Dynamics.

This library is in a very early stage of development. Most of the functions are adapted from the [MATLAB library](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orca_matlab_source) provided by Iris Dynamics.

## Installation

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as the dependency management tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EzekielDaun/orca-py.git
cd orca-py
poetry install
```

## Example Usage

See [`tests`](./tests/) for example usage.

```bash
poetry run python ./tests/{name}.py
```
