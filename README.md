# ORCA-py

ORCA-py is an **unofficial** library for the [ORCA Series](https://irisdynamics.com/products/orca-series) motor from Iris Dynamics.

This library is in a very early stage of development. Most of the functions are adapted from the [MATLAB library](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orca_matlab_source) provided by Iris Dynamics.
